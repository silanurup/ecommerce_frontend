# Online Shopping Website

This project is a simple and responsive e-commerce website that showcases products and offers for an online shopping platform. It includes a home page with a search bar, product advertisements, and a section dedicated to cricket equipment. The website is built using HTML and CSS for layout and styling.

## Features

- **Header with Navigation**: The header contains a logo, navigation links (home, about, contact), and a search bar for users to find products easily.
- **Responsive Product Display**: The main section includes a slider image for promotions and product cards for cricket equipment with special offers.
- **Footer**: A simple footer with copyright information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For layout and styling.
    - `style.css`: Main styles for the website layout and design.
    - `utils.css`: Utility classes for common styling adjustments (e.g., margins, paddings, flexbox).

## Project Structure

- **HTML File:**
    - `index.html`: The main file that contains the structure of the webpage.
  
- **CSS Files:**
    - `css/style.css`: Contains the styles for the website (such as colors, fonts, layout).
    - `css/utils.css`: Contains utility classes for general styling like margins, paddings, and alignment.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure that the following files are in the correct directories:
    - `index.html` in the root directory.
    - `style.css` and `utils.css` in the `css/` directory.
    - Images (`logo.png`, `cricket.jpg`, etc.) should be in the appropriate directories as referenced in the HTML.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the website.

## Future Improvements

- Add more product categories and dynamically load product data.
- Implement a shopping cart and checkout functionality.
- Improve the responsiveness of the website for mobile devices.
- Add animations or transitions for better user interaction.
